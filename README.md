## Hi there 👋

I'm a budding Frontend Web Developer with a background as a Freelance Graphic Designer for approximately 15 years. In 2024, I transitioned into Web Development. I've dabbled in HTML and CSS for many years. Now that Im learning Javascript, its opened up a whole new world with design! The more I work with code, the more I love it. ❤️
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Many of my personal practice projects reference my cat, Minerva. 😻
